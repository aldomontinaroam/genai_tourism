Our team was to be in charge of bringing useful insights to the Italian Minister of Tourism regarding the current use and possible future uses of Generative AI in the field of tourism.

- **Countries:** Are other EU countries investing in GenAI, and to what extent?
- **Public Entities:** How can Destination Management Organizations (DMOs) use GenAI to enhance tourist attraction efforts?
- **Tourist Behavior:** In what phases of the travel planning journey is GenAI relevant? How might planning and booking behaviors change with GenAI integration?
